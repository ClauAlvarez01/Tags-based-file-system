# Tags-based-file-system
A distributed systems project

## Project Description

This project implements a distributed file system that uses tags for file organization and management. Instead of relying on a traditional hierarchical folder structure, files are identified and searched using tags, providing a more flexible and dynamic way to handle large volumes of distributed data.
